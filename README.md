## Problem Statement
The concept of monetary has existed since ancient times, and it takes people lots of time and effort to book-keep their financial records accurately in a manual way. Errors often occur when handling a huge amount of numerical data such as our income and expenses, since organizing and manipulating data by human alone may not be reliable. It is also difficult and time-consuming for people to monitor their financial status through manual accounting, as a great amount of records has to be carefully reviewed in order to extract only the useful financial records, and to generate the desired financial report. It is complicated for human to sort and filter their transaction records from existing handwritten financial records too. Therefore, a lot of limitations exist if people really want to manage their financial records manually.

## Problem Setting
To solve the above problems, a digital accounting system is introduced to replace the traditional yet time-consuming manual book-keeping method. It aids the user in managing his finances. It is a simple account manager to keep a record of your daily expenses and income on your device. It eliminates the need of carrying a physical cashbook and does the balance calculation on its own. It provides a simple and user-friendly way to edit records in case some correction is needed. You can view monthly account summary anytime you want. It works even if there is no internet connection available.

## Program Features
The newly developed accounting program includes the following functions:
1. to add records of income and expenses, which contain general information like the amount received/spent, the date of transaction, the type of income/expenses and the corresponding financial account involved;
2. to edit or delete any records that are previously added to the system;
3. to view the stored financial records sorted or filtered by different criteria;
4. to generate monthly statistical report of the users’ financial state upon request;
5. to set a budget for the users’ expenses and alert them when their expenses reach the set budget; and
6. to forecast the income and expenses for the next time period based on the previous financial records stored in the system.
